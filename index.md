# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine learning algorithms for different real world datasets. Please feel free to contact me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/mkgreen/Bike-Rental-Demand/blob/main/Linear_Regression_Project_Seoul_Bike_Data.ipynb)

<img src="images/seoul-bikes.jpeg?raw=true"/>

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**94%** accuracy](https://github.com/suvo-gh/Bike-Rental-Demand/blob/main/Bike_Rental_Demand.ipynb).

- Used Random Forest Regressor to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration
