**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib,XGboost Classifier, BaggingClassifier

**Project Objective:** In this problem, we will use the features associated with clicks, such as IP address, operating system, device type, time of click etc. to predict the probability of a click being fraud.

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the Pepole who downloaded the app after watching the advertisement  with an accuracy of 97% .

- Used the XGboost Classifier algorithm to classify the Pepole who downloaded the app after watching the advertisement and identify the click fraud
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a BaggingClassifier model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Identification of the type of Breast Cancer for quicker diagnosis. This assists professionals in the medical field to take appropiate measures to accurately diagnose, treat and save lives. 

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in [**80%** accuracy using K-means algorithm](https://github.com/mkgreen/Breast-Cancer-Classification/blob/main/Breast_cancer_classification_algorithm.ipynb).

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/mkgreen/Orthopedic-Patients-Classification-KNN-NB/blob/main/ortho_project.ipynb)

![knee-brace-ortho](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105948938/210697291-f37f4d78-f7f5-48e8-b7fd-4375a9254df3.png)

**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib,KNN,NB

**Project Objective:** In this project we are provided with multiple instances of orthopedic parameters and we are also provided with their classification as Normal or Abnormal. We have to implement K Nearest Neighbour, the algorithm is used to classify points according to class of their K nearest neighbour points .

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the orthopedic parameters as Normal or Abnormal with an accuracy of 85.48% .

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

[Prediction of user interest using bank data](https://github.com/mkgreen/Banking-Classification-Logistic-Regression/blob/main/Portugese%20Banking%20Classification.ipynb)

![banking](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105948938/210697085-9f12b658-be7a-4493-afd1-10c9aaf397d5.jpeg)


**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** In this project you will be provided with real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

**Quantifiable result:** We could Classify the type of tumor resulting in 85% accuracy using Logistic Regression and SMOTE .

- in this project we are given real world data which is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution.
- The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y).

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on demand of Bike rentals](https://github.com/mkgreen/Bike-Rental-Demand/blob/main/Linear_Regression_Project_Seoul_Bike_Data.ipynb)

![seoul-bikes](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/105948938/210696437-cb69d9ae-3f14-4792-a80c-0c6f938cac36.jpeg)


**Skills used:** Python, Pandas, SKlearn, Matplotlib

**Project Objective:** Predicting Bike rental demand on basis of weather and seasonal factors in advance to take appropiate measures which finally will result in bike utilization.

**Quantifiable result:** We could predict the Bike rental demand resulting in [**94%** accuracy](https://github.com/mkgreen/Bike-Rental-Demand/blob/main/Linear_Regression_Project_Seoul_Bike_Data.ipynb).

- Used Random Forest Regressor to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Cross Validation for validating the training data and model fit.
- Fit a Random Forest Regressor with high prediction accuracy through iteration
